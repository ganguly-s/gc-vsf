### Title: 
Code to compute velocity structure function (VSF) of 2D velocity data maps provided

### Description:
This code was originally written by Dr. Yuan Li to carry out VSF calculations for a
novel method involving detection of turbulence in galaxy cluster cores (refer to paper).
It was reorganized and generalized to include additional modules such as applying flux
cuts to remove noisy data, remove bulk rotation, construct simultaneous MUSE/ALMA data VSFs
and carry out power-law fitting, for the purpose of detecting turbulence signatures in
a larger catalogue of galaxy cluster data. Future plans to improve error analysis are 
currently in progress.
